# task
I built a responsive single-page website using Bootstrap 5 with a simple file structure (index.html, CSS, JS, and images). Bootstrap was linked via CDN, and I also used Bootstrap Icons for visuals. 

The site includes a sticky navbar, hero section, features, about/services, contact form, and footer. I remixed Bootstrap components instead of copying templates. The contact form was made functional using Netlify Forms. 

For styling, I mainly used Bootstrap utility classes and added small custom CSS for shadows, colors, and spacing. The site was tested on desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure responsiveness. 

I used Bootstrap docs, Netlify docs, and ChatGPT for guidance. The main challenges were keeping spacing consistent, handling the sticky navbar, and making the form work without a backend â€” solved with Bootstrap utilities and Netlify form handling. 

This project improved my responsive design skills, taught me form integration without backend, and gave me experience in creating a clean, modern, and consistent website.
